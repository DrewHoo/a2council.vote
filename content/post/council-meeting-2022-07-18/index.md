This is a relatively light [agenda](http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=914276&GUID=16115387-C2FF-426B-B745-16D83911AB1C&Options=&Search=). There are three nominations, twelve items on the Consent Agenda, two ordinance changes at their first reading, no public hearings or ordinances at their second reading, and two resolutions. One person resigned from Renters' Commission due to moving out of the city. CM Eyer was absent, which is why there's no voting data for her.

Of particular interest:

* CA-11, a resolution to remove parking on Barton and install bike lanes, was postponed in 2019 to await the results of the Lower Town Mobility Study which has since completed.
* C-2, an ordinance to alter minimum parking requirements.
* DC-1, a resolution to continue doing checks for compliance with our prevailing wage ordinance.

One note on MC-1, 2, and 3: CM Hayner often votes against mayoral appointments. In the case of MC-3, the Mayor announced that it was unanimous, so I've given him a "yes" vote on that, but on MC-1 and MC-2, they were voice votes and Hayner's vote is not visible on camera. I've left them as "?" until the clerk's minutes are finalized or we can otherwise confirm the votes.
