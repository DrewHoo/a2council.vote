This is a relatively light [agenda](http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=914276&GUID=16115387-C2FF-426B-B745-16D83911AB1C&Options=&Search=). There are three nominations, twelve items on the Consent Agenda, two ordinance changes at their first reading, no public hearings or ordinances at their second reading, and two resolutions. One person resigned from Renters' Commission due to moving out of the city.

Of particular interest:

* CA-11, a resolution to remove parking on Barton and install bike lanes, was postponed in 2019 to await the results of the Lower Town Mobility Study which has since completed.
* C-2, an ordinance to alter minimum parking requirements.
